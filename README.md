- I'm currently learning Python and Pygame.
- Trying to find a way to remember every function and become better with critical thinking.
- I've been making apps, games, and other such thing that I should and sometimes might put them here.

- Tools I use to make assets and code games:{
VSCode,
Asesprite,
Boscacelio (if anyone knows a better music-making program; let me know),
Tiled,
and a random sound effect generator.
}
